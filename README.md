## Setup
I used Python 3.9.13 to develop the app.

To run the app on your local machine you will need to install some Python packages. 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need to install the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) on your system, which is available from most package managers:

```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```

Lastly, run the following command to launch the Streamlit app.
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
